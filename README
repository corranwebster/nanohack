NanoHack
========

NanoHack is an HTML5 and javascript port and extension of the TinyHack game
(http://boingboing.net/rob/tinyhack/) originally written in Flash by Rob
Beschizza of BoingBoing.

The code consists of a fairly generic and extensible JavaScript library
for building TinyHack-like games, together with a simple web-page which
uses the nanohack.js library to create a TinyHack clone.

Notes
-----

Currently this is known to work on Chrome on OS X.  It will probably work on
Chrome on any platform.  The audio files are .mp3 format, so sound probably
won't work on Firefox.

WARNING: the audio causes a hard crash under Safari on OS X.

My primary language for writing software is Python, and it probably shows in
the way that I write javascipt.

I deliberately wrote this without using any of the major javascript
frameworks, but in the future this may need to change to provide better
cross-browser support (in particular, a good audio library would be a
worthwhile dependency, it seems).
