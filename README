NanoHack
========

NanoHack is a JavaScritp port and extension of the TinyHack game
(http://boingboing.net/rob/tinyhack/) by Rob Beschizza of BoingBoing.

The code consists of a fairly generic and extensible JavaScript library
for building TinyHack-like games, together with a simple web-page which
uses the nanohack.js library to run a TinyHack clone.
